    <h1>Professional Self Assessment</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I grew from a technical support professional into a confident full stack and security-minded developer. Building this portfolio and enhancing three artifacts strengthened my design, analytical, and problem solving abilities while applying industry practices in secure software development. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design scalable software, implement efficient algorithms, and manage secure database operations.
    </p>

    <h2>Software design and engineering</h2>
    <p>
      My InvenTrack mobile app evolved from a simple Android project into a refactored solution following MVVM. I implemented encrypted storage with EncryptedSharedPreferences, password hashing with PBKDF2, and role based access to protect data. These enhancements improved modularity, maintainability, and usability while applying secure mobile architecture and object oriented design.
    </p>

    <h2>Algorithms and data structures</h2>
    <p>
      In the Course Advising Program I combined a Binary Search Tree with a HashMap to optimize lookups and scalability. I conducted Big O analysis, added cycle detection for data integrity, and documented tradeoffs between runtime and memory. This work strengthened my analytical thinking and my ability to select appropriate data structures for real problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Databases</h2>
    <p>
      The Grazioso Salvare dashboard demonstrates database design and secure full stack skills. I implemented a TLS secured MongoDB Atlas connection, JSON Schema validation, and role based access control. Using Dash and Flask, I built an interactive interface backed by a real time database with attention to validation and performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Collaboration, communication, and security mindset</h2>
    <p>
      Across all artifacts I followed version control best practices, iterated in small increments, and documented progress for both technical and non technical audiences. I anticipate vulnerabilities during requirements, validate input to protect data, and test for functionality and performance. I approach each project with a security first mindset that balances usability, reliability, and protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Career readiness</h2>
    <p>
      Completing this program shaped my professional goals and confirmed my focus on cybersecurity and software engineering. The combination of full stack development, algorithmic problem solving, and secure data design prepares me to contribute in roles such as Cyber Threat Operations Engineer or Secure Software Developer.
